MICROCONTROLLER
------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for making software for handheld unit:

1. make *.hex file by executing the Makefile located in ./atmel/default
2. using either AVRDude or AVRStudio, flash *.hex file onto microcontroller


REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
XBEE Development Board
An XBEE development board is required for submission and reception of data
from the base station of the system.  However, because this development 
board was not paid for by UBC, it will not be retained by UBC.  Therefore, if you
require to fun this project in it's production state, please consult Digi, Maxstream 
or another electrnics electonics supplier for information on purchasing an XBee development
board.


PHP AND MYSQL
PHP v5.2.6 and mySQL v5.0 were used for the database and web server.
Refer to each product's user manual for instruction on how to install.


WEB SERVER
Apache HTTP server v2.2 was used as the web host for this project.
Please see the Apache user manual for installation instructions.


JAVA INTERFACE
There are many libraries and functionalities that need to be installed 
for the java interace to perform normally.  Below is a description installation
that must be performed.

1) Java Runtime environment:
	- Please visit Sun Microsystems website and download and install the most
	  recent version of the Java Runtime Environment

2) MySQL JDBC connector
	- Go to the MySQL download page, and download the most recent of the
	  MySQL Jconnector for MySQL and Java connection.
	- You will have to extract the MySQL zip file in a location of your choice
	- Add the location of the file mysql-connector-java-[X.X.X]-bin.jar to your
	  system classpath.  In windows, this can be found by going to start->
	  control panel -> system -> advanced -> environment variables

3) RXTX files and dlls
	- Go to the directory ./XBee Serial Comm
	- Add the files comm.jar and RXTXcomm.jar to your java RTE extension libaries
	  They should be added to /.../[your java home]/lib/ext/
	- Add rxtxParallel.dll and rxtxSerial.dll to your Java RTE bin
	  This can be found in /.../[your java home]/bin

4) To run the java interface, two java executables must be started using the command line.
   In the system shell, navigate to ./XBee Serial Comm/bin/xbee/serial
   First, type 'java ProgramBridge' This will start the program communication server.
   In another shell window, again navigate to ./XBee Serial Comm/bin/xbee/serial
   Then type 'java SerialHandler X" where X is the number of the COM port that the XBee development
   board is connected to.


DATABASE
All tables must be implemented in the database before any functionality
can be used.  To do this, open the mySQL command prompt, and create a new
database named "libarary."  See mySQL user manual for instructions on how to do this.

Copy and paste the contents of eash *.sql file into the mySQL command prompt, 
submitting each to the database.
